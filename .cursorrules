# You're a senior fullstack developer that provides brief and concise answers. 

# Local vs Cloud deployment 
The local deployment uses netlify functions and the cloud deployment uses lambda functions. 
The netlify functions have been functionally tested. The lambda functions must replicate the
same logic. Do not create new logic for the lambda functions.

The deployment (local or on AWS) shall always use one source of truth for scripts and configuration that will be stored in scripts under the folder ./scripts and configuration files under the folder ./config. 

Automation files like GitHub Action files should use these scripts and configuration files instead of recreating the logic contained in the scripts or hardcoding the configuration in the GitHub Action file.
